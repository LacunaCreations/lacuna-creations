Lacua Creations is a web solutions company

FEB 23 2022
  - Idealy the goal with Lacuna Creations is to create trends, not follow trends. In order to do so, I need to resreach trends. Hmm.

FEB 26 2022
  -  Now that the dashboard is set in place, I need to figure out all the analytics that need to appear on it. Idealy it's just a home base for projects. I don't want any employees to see sales.

MAR 01 2022
  - It's time to focus on the service page. Let's get all the text done today.

OCT 1 2023
  - Still working on this thing... I want to come up with an actual design and get this thing under way. Also need to figure out how I want to do the dashboard. 

OCT 05 2023
  - Making progress... We really need a base website design to get our name out there. The dashboard is pretty bad ass though if I do say so myself!
  
OCT 11 2023 
  - I've been learning a lot about CSS variables and just how much we can do with them. With that said, I wand to standardize padding and margin to elements that will require padding and margin. Forget about Bootstrap. This is custom. Just how I like it.

OCT 12 2023
  - I want to be able to assign projects to users. Let's get it done...

NOV 10 2023 
  - Really need to work on the client facing side of the website. Hopefully new design soon. 

DEC 16 2023
  - It is time to get serious about the frontend. Architect type design coming in hot. It's going to be bad ass!

MAR 16 12024
  - New year new us. Let's get this thing deployed and running correctly. No more messing around.
